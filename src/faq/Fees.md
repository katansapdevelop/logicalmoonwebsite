### Why?
To cover our running costs for cloud hosting fees and for our time to monitor and keep everything up & running, we currently charge a fee of 1.75% .  This fee is drawn down from any staking rewards you earn whilst staking with us and works the same for all other validators.  For more details, please refer to the [Radix Staking and Incentive Rewards Guide](https://www.radixdlt.com/post/radix-staking-and-incentive-rewards-guide)

<br /> 

### Fee Change Process
Like any other validator we can change the fee % at any time. If we plan to increase the percentage, we would give you advance notification via our twitter account, the discord channel and via your Wallet by sending a coin with a message attached to give you an opportunity to unstake and restake with another validator of your choice.    
<br />
It's not something we plan to to any time soon, as it has a huge impact to our stakers to unstake.  The process takes about 2 weeks currently and during this time you accrue no rewards.  So please do factor this in when choosing an appropriate validator
