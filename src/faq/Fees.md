### Why?
To cover our running costs for cloud hosting fees and for our time to monitor and keep everything up & running, we currently charge a fee of 1.75% to help cover this.  This fee is drawn down from any staking rewards you earn from whilst staking with us.  For more details refer to the [Radix Staking and Incentive Rewards Guide](https://www.radixdlt.com/post/radix-staking-and-incentive-rewards-guide)

### Fee Change Process
Like any validator we can change fees at any time, but if we plan to do so, we would give you notification via our twitter account and the discord channel to give you an opportunity to unstake and restake with another validator of your choice.
