### How to Choose a Validator
The complete list of validators are listed on the [Radix Explorer](https://explorer.radixdlt.com/#/validators).  You can find details for Logical Moon on the Radix Explorer [here](https://explorer.radixdlt.com/#/validators/rv1qtzlupqghjyvdsp3nn0cpkdvmtrfe7ac8czump5r6hgm0rnlhvznj88xw7a).  Note in the interests of the network, please select a validator that falls below the line in the Radix Explorer

In addition to this we find the [Radix Dashboard](https://www.radixdashboard.com/) by Auvant Staking a really useful tool
