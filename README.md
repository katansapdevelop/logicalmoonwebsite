# Logical Moon Website

The Logical Moon site is built to run using GatsbyJS and leverages the [Gatsby Sass Starter](https://github.com/a2zarslaan/gatsby-starter-sasslan).

# Getting Started

## Requirements
- Node.js version 14 (use NVM to switch to 14 if required)
- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-cli)
- [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Quick Start

Run the following in your favorite terminal:

```
gatsby new [directory] https://github.com/a2zarslaan/gatsby-starter-sasslan
```

## Starting from Scratch

- Set up Npm: (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)[https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm]
- Install the Gatsby CLI globally:

```
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

- Inside the directory of your choice, scaffold a new Gatsby site:

```
gatsby new [directory] https://github.com/a2zarslaan/gatsby-starter-sasslan
```

For example, if I want my installation in `~/Code/new-gatsby-site`, I would navigate to `~/Code` and run:

```
gatsby new new-gatsby-site https://github.com/a2zarslaan/gatsby-starter-sasslan
```

- Navigate to your new directory and run:

```
npm run develop
```

- You should now be running your new Gatsby site locally! ðŸŽ‰

- For quick deploy as a Github pages site, run:

```
npm run deploy
```
